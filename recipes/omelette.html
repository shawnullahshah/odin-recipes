            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make a veggie omelette, dice 1 cup of your favorite vegetables. Then, over medium-high heat, sauté the vegetables and garlic in olive oil until soft, about 3-5 minutes depending on the vegetables you choose.</li>
            <li>To make a bacon omelette, begin by cooking the bacon, garlic and onion over medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes). Set aside. You can use breakfast sausage in place of bacon. </li>
            <li>Begin by whisking the eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout). This step is incredibly important, you want to beat those eggs until there are no pieces of whites separated from the yolks.</li>
            <li>Then, whisk in the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Next, melt the butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. It’s very important that you use an 8″ pan. If you use a larger pan the omelet will be too thin, a smaller pan will yield a very thick omelet.</li>
            <li>Then, add the whisked eggs and swirl them in the pan until they are evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Next, cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. Please don’t rush the process, low heat is important when cooking omelettes so they don’t overcook.</li>
            <li>Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.</li>
            <li>Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Then, sprinkle the cheese over the top of the omelette and add the toppings on one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Then, gently fold the other half over the toppings.</li>
            <li>Serve the omelette immediately. You can garnish with herbs, chives, additional toppings, extra cheese, etc.</li>
        </ol>
